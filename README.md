# records-by-request
This application will be implemented into a project-specific setting. 

The Records by Request project provides secure storage and digitization of paper archives for many companies.
It is not always efficient to digitize an entire archive at once, which is why RBR is the perfect solution.
Companies can request specific charts to be queued for digitization and to then be imported via a HIPAA-compliant client portal.

This application is intended to address the inefficencies of the Excel-based request tracking system.

Core features of the RBR Request Manager include:

1) Ability to establish a connection to an external database used to house request data
2) Ability to search, navigate, sort, and push updates to the database (mostly status changes of the digitization workflow)
3) Automaticically generated SMTP notifications to clients and company admins regarding any issues in the workflow
4) Automatic chart tracking information collected from updates made to a MANIFEST collection
